/**
 * Decides which Herdr state changes deserve a phone notification, so a Herdr
 * session notifies from what Herdr knows instead of the bell and idle guesses:
 *
 * - nothing on the first snapshot after a connect (that is the state you left,
 *   not news);
 * - an agent that turns blocked and stays blocked for [holdMs] gets one
 *   [Notice.NeedsYou] (a momentary blocked, an agent asking itself, does not);
 * - the same pane blocking again within [repeatWindowMs] of that notice gets
 *   nothing more;
 * - an agent that goes from blocked or working to done gets one [Notice.Finished];
 * - nothing for the agent you are already looking at (its session on screen and
 *   its pane focused in Herdr).
 *
 * Pure: feed it each poll with the time from [clock]; it keeps per-pane memory.
