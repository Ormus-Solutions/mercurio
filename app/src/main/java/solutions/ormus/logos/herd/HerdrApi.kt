/**
 * Herdr CLI command building and output parsing (control plane).
 *
 * Everything runs through SSH.execDetailed on the authenticated connection
 * (reuses the connection, never interrupts the shell). Behaviour measured on
 * herdr 0.8.0 (Termish) and 0.9.0 (Sun):
 * - `herdr api snapshot`: JSON with result.snapshot (see HerdrModels)
 * - `herdr pane read`: the terminal content as plain text, no JSON wrapper
 * - `herdr agent prompt`: success prints the CLI wrapper JSON; failure **exits
 *   non-zero (exit 1) with the error JSON on stderr** (such as
 *   `{"error":{"code":"agent_not_found",...},"id":"cli:agent:prompt"}`), so
 *   [parseCommandError] must look at the whole [CommandOutput] (stderr + exit
 *   code); reading only stdout would silently treat a failure as success.
