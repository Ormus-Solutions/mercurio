/**
 * Spots the Herdr client dropping its server connection in a session's output, so the
 * session can attach again. Herdr's server keeps every pane and agent, so a new `herdr`
 * comes back to the same place.
 *
 * Measured on Sun (herdr 0.9.0, a client in a pty): on exit the client leaves the
 * alternate screen (`ESC[?1049l`), resets a few modes, then prints `herdr: <reason>`.
 * Requiring that exit sequence right before the words means an agent printing the same
 * words inside a pane (which Herdr draws itself, never with that sequence) does not
 * count. Only a lost connection counts: "server shut down" is a stop on purpose.
